1. What is variant calling?  
Variant calling is the process by which we _identify variants_ from our sequence data.  
Here we see the example of Variant calling:  
![A CRAM file aligned to a reference genomic region as visualised in Ensembl. Differences are highlighted in red in the reads, and will be called as variants.](https://github.com/katerinaoleynikova/MIPT/blob/main/variant_calling_example.png)
A CRAM file aligned to a reference genomic region (as visualised in Ensembl). Differences are highlighted in red in the reads, and will be called as variants.  
Variant calling entails identifying single *nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)* and *small insertions and deletions (indels)*.  
2. What is SNPs?  
In genetics, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP /snɪp/; plural SNPs /snɪps/) is a germline substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome. Although certain definitions require the substitution to be present in a sufficiently large fraction of the population (e.g. 1% or more), many publications do not apply such a frequency threshold.  
For example, at a specific base position in the human genome, the G nucleotide may appear in most individuals, but in a minority of individuals, the position is occupied by an A. This means that there is a SNP at this specific position, and the two possible nucleotide variations – G or A – are said to be the _alleles_ for this specific position.  
SNPs pinpoint differences in our susceptibility to a wide range of diseases. The severity of illness and the way the body responds to treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations caused by SNPs.  
3. What is indels?  
Indel is a molecular biology term for an insertion or deletion of bases in the genome of an organism. It is classified among small genetic variations, measuring from 1 to 10 000 base pairs in length, including insertion and deletion events that may be separated by many years, and may not be related to each other in any way. A microindel is defined as an indel that results in a net change of 1 to 50 nucleotides.

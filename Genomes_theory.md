1. What is variant calling?  
Variant calling is the process by which we _identify variants_ from our sequence data.  
Here we see the example of Variant calling:

A CRAM file aligned to a reference genomic region (as visualised in Ensembl). Differences are highlighted in red in the reads, and will be called as variants.
